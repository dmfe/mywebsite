# systemd

_systemd_ is a suit of basic building blocks for a linux system.
It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system.

## Basic systemctl usage

The main command used to introspect and control _systemd_ is `systemctl`.
Some of its uses are examinig the system state and managing the system and services.

### Using units

Units commonly include, but are not limited to, services (.service), mount points (.mount),
devices (.device) and sockets (.socket). When using `systemctl`, you generally have to
specify the complete name of the unit file, including suffix, for example `sshd.socket`.
There are a few short forms when specifying the unit int the following `systemctl` commands:
- If you do not specify the suffix, systemctl will assume _.service_
- Mount points will automatically be translated into the appropriate _.mount_ unit.
  For example `/home` is equivalent to `home.mount`
- Similar to mount points, devices are automatically translated into the appropriate _.device_ unit.
  Therefore specifying `/dev/sda2` is equivalent to `dev-sda2.device`
